This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can reach the site at 
The Goal of this project is to make a website that can provide quick market data without opening multiple
browser tabs. Too many time do i just google stock ticker into google to get quick stock data and it just disappoint me.
With this website the first thing you will see is the current live data of some of the most popular index etf.
Then on the Home Screen you can add any stock data it by simply inputting ticker to the search bar.
The stock data will then will be remember by the site unless the user leave or refresh the pages.
The next feature is daily stock performance of the 6 largest company by marketcap for the past 30 days on the year.
